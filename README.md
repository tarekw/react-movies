## INSTRUCTIONS

The test consist on the creation of a web application in React that in the landing page will show a list of movies and when one of this is clicked, it takes you to another page where more detail info about the movie is displayed. The data will be retrieved via the provided public API:

For the list of movies:

`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=c857fa67fba523ad3ce66df18e7ab279&language=en-US&sort_by=popularity.desc&include_adult=false&include_video=false&page=1`

For the single movie details:

`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${id}?api_key=65e043c24785898be00b4abc12fcdaae&language=en-US`

And for the images root path:

`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300`

Note: This endpoints are already in `./src/App.js` in a commented `const` for easier set up.
